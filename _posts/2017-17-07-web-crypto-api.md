Proof of Identity is a primary problem for any network protocol and the World Wide Web (HTTP) is no different. Introduction of the state management RFC in 1997<sup><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> led to use common use of Cookie headers to maintain a state of identity in HTTP sessions. These identities have been dominantly powered by logical authentication mechanism.
