## Overview
Proof of Identity is a primary problem for any network protocol and the World Wide Web (HTTP) is no different. Introduction of the state management RFC in 1997<sup><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> led to use common use of Cookie headers to maintain a state of identity in HTTP sessions. These identities have been dominantly powered by logical authentication mechanisms. The world wide web has progressed far ahead in its adoption of identities that are authenticated by trusted delegates. These identities still aren't universal over the world wide web. A central authority is required to act as a delegate and authenticate a user. While these identities inter-operate, there's isn't a single central authority that controls these identities. To remain aligned with the philosophy of the open web, there shouldn't be such a centralized entity. This paper discusses the possibility of extending cryptographic identities in the way they are being used in Distributed Ledger Technologies (popularly known as Blockchains), while keeping in mind the expected operational simplicity for an Internet user. Such identities would always keep the user in control and could be utilized by modern age applications to extend services with end-to-end encryption.

 Centrally controlled logical identities put control in hands of web services. Users need to maintain full control of their identities, especially those that affect their social and economic credibility. Cryptographic identities can help regain this control.

Delegated authentication protocols such as OAuth while being of tremendous utility, escalate the problem of identities being centrally controlled by a select few service providers.
