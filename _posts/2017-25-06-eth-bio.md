# Bio

| Project URL | [http://0x8.in/bio](http://0x8.in/bio)                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | A twitter feed powered by Ethereum smart-contracts.    |
| Status      | In progress                                            |

Bio is an experiment with data feed like contracts published on the Ropsten Testnet. Users can get a friendly handle for themselves, and publish their Bio in shape of a smart contract. Users can also update their statuses after creating a Bio Contract.

Feel free to play with the Dapp on the testnet. The contracts will change occasionally until the ABIs are finalized.

## Features and milestones

- A Bio Directory contract to story friendly names ✓
- Bio contract view with Gravatar and Bio ✓
- Permission for Bio Contract owners to update status ✓
- Add event and logs view on the Dapp
- Finalize and publish contract ABIs

The Dapp is hosted for purely experimental purposes without any guarantees.
