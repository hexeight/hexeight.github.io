<center>Experiments with distributed, decentralized networks.</center>

Recent progress in distributed ledgers, filesystems and networks got me interested in the possiblities of a truely decentralized computing network. [0x8](http://0x8.in) (hexeight) is where I plan to archive my experiments and thoughts that align with these possibilities. Not every project here might make good business sense. My intention here is to learn through experimentation.

I welcome anyone willing to contribute with pull requests.

## Why?

For the last 8 years I have been building web applications, and clients that talk to them. I spent a good part of 2017 studying blockchains, distributed filesystems like IPFS and network protocols like I2P.

Coming from a culture of centralized trust - where packets arrive from a single trusted computer on the network and with little background of cryptography, I had my doubts about the viability of this tech. My skeptcisim drove me into investing more time to understand ~~how~~ why it works.

Even after almost 30 years since the inception of the World Wide Web, users on the Internet fall prey to phishing scams<sup>[1]</sup> and phony emails<sup>[2]</sup>. The struggle to understand what many claim to be the Web 3.0<sup>[3]</sup> made me realize that we would witness many more blunders<sup>[4]</sup> if these are not understood well enough by contributors on the network.

These democratic networks, many of which rely on consensus can add incredible value. They hold promise to solve some of the most critical problems that we face as society<sup>[5]</sup>. But they are at risk of falling apart if we are not to educate ourselves right.

>Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.
