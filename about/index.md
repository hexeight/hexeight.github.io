<center>Experiments with distributed, decentralized networks.</center>

The recent wave of dApps got me interested in the possiblities of a truely decentralized computing network. Hexeight (0x8) is pet project where I plan to archive my projects, experiments and thoughts that align with these possibilities. Not every project here might good business sense. My intention here is to only learn through application.

I welcome anyone willing to contribute with pull requests.

## Why?

For the last 8 years I have been building web applications, and clients that talk to these web apps. I spent a good part of 2017 studying blockchains, distributed filesystems like IPFS and network protocols like I2P.

Coming from a culture of centralized trust - where packets arrive from a single trusted computer on the network with little background of cryptography, I had my doubts about the viability of this tech. My skeptcisim drove me into investing more time to understand ~~how~~ why it works.

Even after almost 30 years since the inception of the World Wide Web, users on the Internet fall prey to phishing scams and phony emails. The struggle to understand what many claim to be the Web 3.0 made me realize that we would witness many more blunders if we are not educate ourselves right.

These democratic networks many of which reply on consensus have a lot to offer. They hold promise to solve some of the most critical problems that we face as a society. But they are at risk of falling apart if we are not to educate ourselves right.
