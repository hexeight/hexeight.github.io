<center>Experiments with distributed, decentralized networks.</center>

The recent wave of dApps got me interested in the possiblities of a truely decentralized computing network. Hexeight (0x8) is pet project where I plan to archive my projects, experiments and thoughts that align with these possibilities.

I welcome anyone willing to contribute with pull requests.
